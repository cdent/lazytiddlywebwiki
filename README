This is an experimental TiddlyWeb plugin to do loading of tiddlers after
the tiddlywiki has initially booted.

It's goal is to lower the amount of data transferred in the first
request.

It needs http://github.com/cdent/lazytiddlers/blob/master/LazyTiddlersPlugin.js
to operate. It is not currently packaged with the plugin because of 
difficulties with tiddlywebplugins.instancer.
