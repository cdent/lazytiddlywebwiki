This is an experimental TiddlyWeb plugin to enforce loading of tiddlers after
the tiddlywiki has initially started.

It's goal is to lower the amount of data transferred in the first
request.

It needs a plugin like http://lazy.tiddlyspace.com/LoadMissingTiddlersPlugin
to be present in the wiki to be useful.
